# **Matrix Survey**

 This is a Webpage with a survey for an imaginary service that lets you "try out being the chosen one". You fill out the application form and customize your own personal team with love interest and more.

 ## Project Details
 I worked on the webpage for a time in December 2021 and want to pick up where i have left of. I publish this project on GitHub on the 29th of June 2022 so i can try to be more organized :D 

 This is one of the Webpages, that i will hand in as part of https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/s "Legacy Responsive Web Design Certification". The goal here is to practice CSS and HTML, so i tried to make EVERYTHING either pure CSS or HTML. It has worked well for most things, except for the code rain in the background. 
 I took inspiration for that from Nr. 17 on https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/animated-backgrounds-css/. Unfortunately for me it is written in Pug and SCSS. I adjusted the code to my needs and preferances and then i "translated" the code with https://pughtml.com/ and https://jsonformatter.org/scss-to-css... 
 It is horrible, i know. If i find a more efficient way to do the same thing, i will change it. 

## Sources
 The __pictures__ of the Matrix charakters are mostly from https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/ (Cypher, Mouse, Switch, Tank and Dozer). The others i have found via Google-image search:
 - Companion Cube: https://wallpapersafari.com/w/AavW2N (Yes, the most important role of the whole Matrix series!!)
 - Apoc: https://www.reddit.com/r/matrix/comments/ptq6y8/whos_your_favorite_character_mine_will_always_be/ (a reddit post :)! )
 - Morpheus; https://www.superherohype.com/news/393263-could-the-new-matrix-movie-center-on-a-young-morpheus
 - Neo:https://www.zbrushcentral.com/t/neo-keanu-reeves-the-matrix/418311" This is actually not a picture of the movie, but from a fanmade 3D-Model. This looks so amazing! You can't really tell the difference right? Great Job @S_M_BONIN !

 The __code rain__, as stated above, is an altered version of https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/animated-backgrounds-css/ translated into pure CSS and HTML with the help of https://jsonformatter.org/scss-to-css and https://pughtml.com/.
